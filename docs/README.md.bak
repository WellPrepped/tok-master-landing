### 1. Summary

tokmaster.com addresses a critical gap in the IB Theory of Knowledge (TOK) education market. While the TOK course was redesigned for first assessment in 2022, it remains the most challenging and opaque component of the IB Diploma Programme for many students. 

Existing competitors (IB Mastery, Revision Dojo) offer static content but lack an integrated workflow solution.

tokmaster.com will be the first platform to deliver a seamless end-to-end experience that guides students through the complete TOK learning journey:

- Concept acquisition
- Exemplar study
- AI-assisted drafting
- Human coaching

This comprehensive approach will be delivered as a SaaS learning environment combined with a tutor marketplace, creating a unique value proposition in the education technology space for IB students.

### 2. User personas

**Grade‑12 IB student** – racing the essay deadline; wants instant idea generation and structure validation.

**Private tutor** – monetises expertise; seeks a storefront and scheduling/payment backend.
